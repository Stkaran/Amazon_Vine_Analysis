# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Purpose
For this analysis, we were tasked with looking at the Amazon Vine Program and how it might affect the reviews of products. This program allows manufacturers amd companies to have guaranteed reviews for their products by having Amazon send their products to Amazon customers who are then required to post a review. The hope being these reviews will garner interest for their products and lead to increased sales. However, with the reviewers getting the products for free or at a discounted price, an issue a of bias in the reviews becomes an issue. To see if there is a bias, we analyzed a dataset of electronic products and compared the reviews of non-vine members to vine members.

## Results 
In the data "N" represents the non-vine and members and "Y" represents vine members.

  * To start we can see that in our dataset there were a lot more non-members with 49,673 being non-members and only 1080 being vine members.

  * Next, the number of 5 star reviews for non-members was 23043 versus 454 for vine members.

  * Lastly, the percentages of five star reviews were quite close being 46% and 42% respectively.

## Summary
Most people's intital assumption would be that due to how the Vine Program is set up to promote company's products, you would think the vine reviewers would disproportionately give more positive reviews. Suprisingly, this is not the case with the vine reviewer's percentage of five star ratings being lower than non-vine members. This analysis doesn't include the entire picture though. If we want to definitively say there is no positivity bias in the program, we would have to look at all of the other star rating percentages as well. Specifically, 4 stars would be the most likely category where this bias may show as it is still a high enough rating where most people come off with a positive view of the product, without expecting perfection like a 5 star rating would denote.
